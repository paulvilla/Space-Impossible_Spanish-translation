 Welcome Captain
 \n
 Space Impossible is currently in the [b][38FAA6]BETA[-][/b] stage of development. This means that while many of the fundamental features are in, content, balance, and smaller features are 
 still in continuously development. There is now a very basic tutorial. You may encounter bugs, crashes and although we make all effort to prevent it saves may be lost at any time. If you do 
 have a problem or think you have found a bug we would be extremely grateful if you let us know.\n\nWe hope you as an early adopter know and except these risks but also know how much you and 
 your feedback help shape the game into its final form.\n\nEnjoy your journey Captain!
